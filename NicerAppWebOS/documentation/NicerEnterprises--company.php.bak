        gavan to whitehouse &amp; Trump family : truthsocial.com is refusing to let me create an account there, AFTER i get telepathically invited to do so, just now.<br/>
        gavan to all : that's a knock out attempt straight to my nose, and i don't appreciate it ;)<br/>
        gavan to all : all i was gonna do is create a symbolic foothold account and self-introducing message; an ad for nicer.app/news<br/>
        gavan to aivd.nl, den haag en politie.nl : i recommend we keep our friendship for and to the US alive and vibrant for at least a little while longer.<br/>
        i will continue to use usmessageboard.com; not the cesspool X, nor truthsocial<br/>
        gavan to all : my own ability to be friends to Americans is not fully destroyed yet, and can probably be restored to full health - by me and me alone.<br/>
        gavan to all : and the planned feature set for my said.by social media and forum features,<br/>
        will blow all social media companies world wide right out of the markets.<br/>
        I know that for sure, but my source codes will continue to stay MIT licensed.<br/>
        I have gut-instinct good reasons for that.<br/>
        gavan to Melania Trump : men can't focus on love making when they are fighting wars or are dead-focussed on creating wealth for their family.<br/>
        gavan to world : my own honesty levels were at '98% honest most of the time'. They degraded somewhat recently, but now it's back up to that +-98%.<br/>
        and i'm practical enough not to be naiive anymore; i know honesty levels are subject to local circumstances.<br/>
        gavan to Baron Trump : i am offering you a job as junior time manager of said.by, if you're interested.<br/>
        [gavan's off to the coffeeshop for breakfast for his lungs; medical hash joints to fetch on Monday, Wednesday and Friday around 7am CEST]<br/>

        gavan to The Devil and all demons : our 'friendship' is over as of right the frigging fuck now.<br/>
        i am done with you.<br/>
        you should never have bullied me.<br/>
        it's very scary when I was a young boy, and later got extremely annoying and frustrating and angering and tiring.<br/>
        especially that : you outnumber me obviously, you demon coward flying (sons of) bitches, and you want to use me as your whipping boy, tool, and sacrificial lamb.<br/>

        gavan to hi-team.cia.gov : I HATE YOU. aivd.nl : you too.<br/>
        gavan to hi-team.cia.gov : needless to say; your continued rootkit usage on my hardware will lead to an eventual
        PERPETUAL SILENCE TREATMENT OF ALL COPS, INTELLIGENCE PERSONELL, BODYGUARD TYPES, AND POLITICAL FIGURES by me.<br/>

        gavan to world : The Christian God, Allah, all of the major Gods, have their diaspora (small communities of true believers) around the world, i don't quite yet (i got only fans and admirers and potential lovers).<br/>
        So i'm not a world-wide being yet. The Gods, ARE.

        Gavan, chief web developer of the Sol solar system's homeworld Earth, to world : I have always been very happy with the performance of the Vatican and all Christian Churches, but I did find their slow startup to police paedophiles and child abusers in their own ranks very distasteful and embarassing and awful and despicable. Sorry, Vatican.<br/>
        My own home is therefore atm my omni-theistic Church building. I do practice monogamy again, with my Angelic wife Emma.<br/>
        I chose her for her sexy charm powers, her supermodel beauty, her intellect and IQ level and EQ level, her courage, her age (her body's around 10 years younger than mine), etc, etc, etc.

        To: aivd.nl and mivd.nl and politie.nl and cia.gov and cyber-teams.nsa.gov<br/>
        From: Gavan P.U.R.A.D. Hoverswell [rene.veerman.netherlands@gmail.com]<br/>
        Subject: your behavior has become unacceptable ever since I got busted for an enthusiastic, unwittingly-meglanomaniac email that i sent to hfh@hfh.org back in the day, about how nobody could stop my rise to becoming what I've recently coined The World President function of Humanity.<br/>
        <br/>
        First you transfer me to the CIA, to let me be lured into a false friendship, then you all try to cut me from behind over 10K times.<br/>
        Need i go on?<br/>
        Piss off out of my life.<br/>
        You hereby have my resignation, and will not get my freedom as a civilian, nor my income (beyond legit taxation and fines) as a businessman.<br/>
        <br/>
        From the moment I graduated from tech school, it was me against the world; I considered myself FINALLY FREE FROM THE SLAVEDRIVERS CALLED <b>TEACHERS</b>.<br/>
        ALSO : ALL bullies, regardless of skincolor or ethnicity, or sexual orientation, will be eradicated. Genocided. You heard me. You're trying to do that to smokers. I'm a smoker.<br/>
        <br/>
        Therefore, I also have quickly come to hate nearly all MANAGERS, SALES-PEOPLE, MARKETING-TYPES, AND EVEN ALL MILITARY, INTELLIGENCE, AND POLICE COMMANDERS AND PERSONELL.<br/>
        In other words : Owners of businesses / income-streams are birds that wanna talk and interact only with other Owners of different businesses / income-streams.
