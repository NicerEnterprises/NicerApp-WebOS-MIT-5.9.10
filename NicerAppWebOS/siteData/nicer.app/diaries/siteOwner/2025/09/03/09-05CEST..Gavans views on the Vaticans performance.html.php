        Gavan, chief web developer of the Sol solar system's homeworld Earth, to world : I have always been very happy with the performance of the Vatican and all Christian Churches, but I did find their slow startup to police paedophiles and child abusers in their own ranks very distasteful and embarassing and awful and despicable. Sorry, Vatican.<br/>
        My own home is therefore atm my omni-theistic Church building. I do practice monogamy again, with my Angelic wife Emma.<br/>
        I chose her for her sexy charm powers, her supermodel beauty, her intellect and IQ level and EQ level, her courage, her age (her body's around 10 years younger than mine), etc, etc, etc.
