        Gavan to <a href="https://whitehouse.gov" class="nomod noPushState" target="wh-gov">WhiteHouse.gov</a> &amp; Trump family : <a href="https://truthsocial.com" class="nomod noPushState" target="ts-com">TruthSocial.com</a> is refusing to let me create an account there, AFTER i get telepathically invited to do so, just now.<br/>
        That's a knock out attempt straight to my nose, and i don't appreciate it ;)<br/>
        All i was gonna do is create a symbolic foothold account and self-introducing message; an ad for nicer.app/news<br/>
        To aivd.nl, den haag en politie.nl : i recommend we keep our friendship for and to the US alive and vibrant for at least a little while longer.<br/>
        i will continue to use usmessageboard.com; and X.com, just not truthsocial.com - which is their loss.<br/>
        My own ability to be friends with Americans is not fully destroyed yet, and can probably be restored to full health - by me and me alone.<br/>
        And the planned feature set for my said.by social media and forum features,<br/>
        will blow all social media companies world wide right out of the markets.<br/>
        I know that for sure, but my source codes will continue to stay MIT licensed.<br/>
        I have gut-instinct good reasons for that.<br/>
        to Melania Trump : men can't focus on love making when they are fighting wars or are dead-focussed on creating wealth for their family.<br/>
        to world : my own honesty levels were at '98% honest most of the time'. They degraded somewhat recently, but now it's back up to that +-98%.<br/>
        And i'm practical enough not to be naiive anymore; i know honesty levels are subject to local circumstances.<br/>
        to Baron Trump : i am offering you a job as junior time manager of said.by, if you're interested.<br/>
        to Donald J. Trump : ok, if I'm considered an elections-interference influencing-danger ;), then by all means keep nicer.app's IP blacklisted on truthsocial.com's create-account pages.<br/>
        [gavan's off to the coffeeshop for breakfast for his lungs; medical hash joints to fetch on Monday, Wednesday and Friday around 7am CEST]<br/>
        to hardcore-international-teams.cia.gov : back off from these friendship gardening trips across 'the big ponds' of mine. for your own good(s).<br/>
